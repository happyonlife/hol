<size=24>Playing the game</size>
- Each player chooses a coloured avatar and places it on the Start square on the gameboard.
- Players play in turn.
- The first player starts the game by rolling the die and moves his/her avatar along the squares given by the number shown on the die. The player then gives the turn to the second player, who will proceed in the same way.

<size=24>If the player stops on</size>
- One of the squares marked with the symbol of the Challenge cards: Let’s Chat!, Stop Online Bullying!, Watch-Out!, Play Safely!, the Challenge question is displayed and the challenged player tries to answer. If the answer is wrong, the player has a second chance to reply. If the answer is still wrong, the challenged player avatar is placed on the STOP square next to the Challenge square to think over his reply. He/she will go on playing from this square at his/her next turn.
- One of the squares marked with the symbol of the Event cards: Move and Lucky cards, the Event statement is displayed and the player receives either a reward or a penalty in the form of additional/less points or increased/decreased squares.
- An Anti-Virus square. Congratulations! The player receives an Anti-Virus! card, which could be useful when stopping on a Virus square (squares 11 and 26).
- A Virus square, where the player is attacked by a computer virus. He/she has to reconfigure everything and waits a turn, unless he/she has an Anti-Virus! card (e.g. acquired from square 4 or square 19).

<size=24>Note</size>
- When stopping on square 8, the waiting time could be longer, you have to proceed by following the arrows on the squares next to it.
